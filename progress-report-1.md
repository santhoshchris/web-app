###What features have you accomplished in the past week?


##I have finished the wireframe for my groceries list web app, with the font, design, and all graphical elements complete along with the basic structure and layout. Tested the wireframe myself and others.


###Did you achieve the previous week’s goals?


##Yes I was able to finish an interactive wireframe which could be browsed using mouse clicks. 


###What are your goals for this week?


##My goals this week are to make the web app functional as much as possible and able to take actual inputs from the user creating his/her grocery list and store them in the database and so on. Also might polish up some of the display aspects to better suit the functionality and coding.


###What concepts or techniques did you learn?


##I learned how to use [Invision App][http://www.invisionapp.com] and also how to actually design rough layouts for web applications just from ideas.


###What parts of the application, in the past week, were enjoyable?

##Definitly designing the images of the fruits, vegetables, etc. choosing the color and font and overall layout. Testing my wireframe and getting feedback from classmates was also interesting.


###What parts of the application, in the past week, were frustrating?

##Changing the design according to the programming requirements and functionality.


###Did you have to radically alter something you’d finished previously?

##Yes. I move around the arrows a bit, added an overall list for all selected items. Also added a edit, save and undo button.
