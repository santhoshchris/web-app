# Research and Development

Ideal user of this application would be someone who wants to shop in a hurry and no time to make a traditional list or knows what items to buy in particular or their prices. Instead he or she simply 
chooses things from a list of categories. Also maybe have a reminder what items are low in stock and required immediately. Easy to use than notepad and paper, thier mobile allows them to buy and
check things off. Items bought disappear as bought. Maybe set a timer like a week so the item bought re-appears after automatically. 

#User Persona: 

Mr.Madison - 32 year old man completely depends on his wife for all the grocery shopping or any shopping for that matter. Infact the only thing he buys for himself is beer. One day his wife leaves for vacation for over
a month without leaving much in the fridge. 

###How this application can help him.

This app categorizes essentials Mr.Madison can browse through quickly without even knowing much what he requires to survive the entire month. Easily he can drag and drop things he needs all in his fingertips. Also list
of shops he can buy each item off appears instantly including directions to them (incorporating Google Maps). Also if his wife used this same app before he can see her ratings on each brand. Best to buy if not available 
the next best rated item on her list etc.

If suppose Mr.Madison is too lazy to create his own shopping list his wife can save and store all the items for him so all he has to do is load it. 

This app can also provide online links to buy if incase he is too busy to drive to the store himself.
